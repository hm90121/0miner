## Guide to setup 0miner as a kubernetes cluster on a single server

This repo enables you to automate joining a 0Chain network and scale capacity in an automated fashion. You can generate m miners, s sharders, and b blobbers. Typically you will use SSD for sharder and blobber data, and since this will grow, you can tier them to S3 servers to scale capacity.  You can use rancher to change config or restart a miner, sharder or blobber. Additionally, you can monitor the resource usage on Grafana, and search logs on Kibana, which are easy interfaces to get an overview of the operation of your server.

## Requirements

- Platform : ubuntu 18.04
- 4 vCPU, 8 Gb Memory (minimum)


## Step 1. Install and setup MicroK8s on Linux
```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.17/stable
sudo snap start microk8s
```
#### Check the status while Kubernetes starts
```bash
sudo microk8s status --wait-ready
export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin
```
### Setup required tools

- Jq
 ```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq -y
```
- Kubectl
 ```bash
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl 

chmod +x ./kubectl 
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl 
kubectl version --client
```

- python3 & pip3  
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip -y
pip3 install -U PyYAML
```

- Helm
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

### Fetch microk8s kubeconfig to access it using kubectl
```bash
sudo su
mkdir ~/.kube
microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
kubectl get po -A
```

## Step 2. Set up the 0chain componets in k8s:

Clone this repository and change the directory to 0chain_setup and run the commands below to set up 0chain components. There are some default configs in utility/config/ directory. Make appropriate changes if you don't want to create the new json from scratch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0chain/0miner.git
cd 0miner/0chain_setup
bash utility/local_k8s.sh 
pip3 install -r utility/requirements.txt
```
Provide the required inputs and you are all done for the microk8s part. 

Note: If running on instance / vm / bare metal, provide public ip range when asked for enabling metallb e.g. 3.134.116.182-3.134.116.182 if public ip of your instance is 3.134.116.182

Note: Microk8s setup does not include dns pointing. You have to make dns entries for your domain pointing to your ip to access the components.

#### (Optional) Create a .env file in 0chain_setup directory if you want to enable minio tiering for sharders and blobbers. 
*Enter values inside quotes accordingly*
```
ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
BUCKET_URL=""
BUCKET_REGION=""
SHARDER_BUCKET_NAME=""
BLOBBER_BUCKET_NAME=""
```
*Enable minio in 0chain_setup/Sharders_tmplt/Configmap/configmap-zchain-yaml-config.yaml*

*Enable minio in 0chain_setup/Blobbers_tmplt/Configmap/configmap-blobber-config.template*

## Configuring 0Chain components

The configuration for 0Chain components is done statically via the `on-prem_input_microk8s_standalone.json`  file located in  0chain_setup/utility/config folder

1. Navigate to the 0chain_setup/utility/config folder

   ```
   cd utility/config
   ```

2. Edit the config file using nano editor

        nano prem_input_microk8s_standalone.json

â€‹      Here is a sample prem_input_microk8s_standalone.json file .


    {
      "cloud_provider": "on-premise",
      "cluster_name": "test",      // Namespace in which all your resources will be created
      "sharder_count": "1",        // number of sharder you want to deploy 
      "miner_count": "1",         // number of miner you want to deploy 
      "blobber_count": "1",      // number of blobber you want to deploy 
      "deploy_main": true, 
      "deploy_auxiliary": true,
      "host_address": "<your-domain>", // Host url for your public IP 
      "host_ip": "18.217.219.7",       // Host ip 
      "kubeconfig_path": "",      // path to your kubeconfig, keep it empty to use system configured kubeconfig
      "n2n_delay": "",           // Delay between node to slow down block creation
      "fs_type": "microk8s-hostpath", // valid file system type (On-premise) [standard/ microk8s-hostpath/ openebs-cstore-sc]
      "repo_type": "0chaintest", // Repository to use 0chainkube or 0chaintest
      "image_tag": "latest",     // image version to be used 
      "record_type": "A",        // Dns record type supported by cloud provider (AWS) [CNAME] || (OCI) [A]
      "deployment_type": "public",   // Use of deployment "PUBLIC" or "PRIVATE"
      "monitoring": {
        "elk": "true", // always true 
        "elk_address": "elastic.<your-domain>", // leave empty if you want to access elk on nodeport
        "rancher": "true",
        "rancher_address": "rancher.<your-domain>",
        "grafana": "true",
        "grafana_address": "grafana.<your-domain>" // leave empty if you want to access grafana on nodeport
      },
      "on_premise": {
        "environment": "microk8s", 
        "host_ip": "18.217.219.7" // Host ip
      },
      "standalone": {
        "public_key": "",
        "private_key": "",
        "network_url": "one.devnet-0chain.net", // url of the network you want to join
        "blobber_delegate_ID": "20bd2e8feece9243c98d311f06c354f81a41b3e1df815f009817975a087e4894",
        "read_price": "",
        "write_price": "",
        "capacity": ""
      }
    }


3.Necessary Configuration Changes 

- The `elk_address`,`rancher_address`,`grafana_adresss` has to be updated with registered domain name
- `host_ip`field has to be updated with Virtual Machine public IPv4 address.
- `host_address` field has to be updated with registered domain name. 


#### Verify and validate the deployment

To verify and validate the deployment visit `https://<network_url>/sharder01/_diagnostics`

#### Check logs and metrices.

When the script is executed, you can check logs and metrices by visiting kibana and grafana urls given as output by the script. Below is an example of how kibana and grafana look after the deployment.

#### Manage Deployment.

To manage pods you can use rancher deployed on rancher.<your-domain>

#### Reset

To reset network for fresh deployment reinstall microk8s using the commands below:

```bash
cd 0miner/0chain_setup
sudo su
bash 0chain-standalone-setup.sh --input-file utility/config/on-prem_input_microk8s_standalone.json --reset true
bash reset.sh
```
Now continue with Step 2. to setup 0chain components.
